# Secret sharing-based QKD routing algorithm

## General information

Here the algorithms for searching an optimal way for routing keys in a quantum key distribution (QKD) network are presented.

Two approaches for the routing are considered: (i) standard one based on the "trusted node paradigm; (ii) the one based on a secret sharing scheme where the resulting key is obtained by XORing keys distributed with disjoint paths.
